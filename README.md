# hello-world
1st repository

Hello World! I'm max and this is my first repository to dump all of my in-the-future works.
This is also my first time learning code and programming since i kept peeking back and fourth to learn them for a while so i decided to set a firm foot on it for a while to see if it fits me at some point or maybe adding new skill/specialty to slightly high my chance to get a job.

As you can see, it's all but a blank repo and this tiny REDME file (for now), I don't have any plan (yet) apart from learning some code and programming languages.
I might upload some of my random project in here in the future (if i still interest in coding at that point)

  Adding "The Rando Number Game.py"
  
  At first I was making a random number generator code but it's kinda get boring real quick so I added some spice to it such as yes/no promt and name promt (also assign specific     name as an easter egg), it might not be that much, programming-wise (also a lot messy with all those IF-ELSEs). but it's very rewarding for a beginner like me.
